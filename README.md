The source code is divided into modules. To install dependencies, type `npm install`. Run in terminal `npm run start` for starting server. Run `npm run build` for building the project.

The functions of play/pause, fast forward and backward by 10 seconds, a progress bar and rewinding with it, selecting a file for playback from the file system, and entering a network source are implemented.

Switching to full screen mode with screen freezing on mobile devices also works.
